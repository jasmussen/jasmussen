I'm Joen, a product designer and creative team lead at Automattic. Spent 15+ years building WordPress, balancing the space between vision and iteration.

I believe good design happens through careful attention to detail and systematic thinking: taking the long view, then breaking it into steps forward. I care about the things that seem small but add up: intentional restraint, thoughtful craft, and building something that feels coherent because someone cared enough to make it that way.

I'm drawn to open source, privacy-first technology, and work that values doing things right over doing them fast. If you work on what you love, you'll create great things.
